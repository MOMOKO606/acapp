Start my first interesting game project -- Battle of Momokos by using Django and Javascript.

The game's website: https://app6423.acapp.acwing.com.cn/


* Use the right button on your mouse to control the movement of your white momoko
* Use q + left mouse button to shoot fireball to attack other colored momokosÔºÅ

Have fun!
